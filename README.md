# AmazonS3ExplorerWPF
WPF-based file explorer for Amazon S3

Why?
----

Ever needed quick access to the files on your S3 account like Windows Explorer, but didn't want to pay for third party software?  Well, this might do the trick for you. 

What does it do?
----------------
    * Uses the AWS profile manager so you can configure the software for any number of accounts
    * Upload and download files and entire folders
    * View individual files using the default program
    * Create, delete, rename and copy/cut "folders" (S3 doesn't really use folders, but this application fakes it for you)
    * Create, delete, rename, and copy/cut files
    

Requirements
------------
    * Windows 7 and up
    * .NET 4.5
    * Amazon Web Services (AWS) account
    * At least one S3 bucket
